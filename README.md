# TextBasedBattleship
C++ Program that plays a extremely skimmed down version of Battleship via text lines

Version - 1.0

Author - Sniff

Plans for future versions - 
1. Add full ships rather that one hit-point ships. 
2. Add print for Battleship board. 
3. Check if the user has tried to shoot at that location before
4. Make it so the User can place ships
5. Make the computer be ablse to fire (randomly)
